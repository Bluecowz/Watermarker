# Watermarker
This program is to add watermarks to images. My hope was to help my GF with here photography business.

At the moment this tool is used on the command line. I might add a UI later.

The script is given a directory containing images and it then creates a folder and it copies and adds a watermark to an image before saving 
it to a watermarked folder. 

Supported images are jpg, jpeg, and png. These are supported because they are the only ones searched for.
